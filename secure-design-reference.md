### Security Governance

Security governance establishes the policies, processes, and frameworks necessary to ensure that security aligns with organizational goals and regulatory requirements. It encompasses areas such as compliance, risk management, and the establishment of accountability within security programs.

---

## The Zero Trust Model

The Zero Trust model is a security concept where no entity, whether internal or external, is trusted by default. Every access request is verified before being granted. This approach is critical for protecting applications from external and internal threats.

---

### Core Principles

1. **Minimal Access**:
   - Provide users, systems, and applications access only to the resources they absolutely need.

2. **Micro-Segmentation**:
   - Divide the network into smaller zones to limit lateral movement by attackers.

3. **Server-Side Validation**:
   - Rely solely on server-side validated data for access control decisions.

4. **Default to Denial**:
   - Ensure user authorization before executing functions.

5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**:
   - Default to a secure state during failures and ensure transactional integrity.

6. **Continuous Verification**:
   - Validate access on all application pages and features, including page reloads.

7. **API Security**:
   - Require bidirectional authentication and authorization for APIs.

8. **Reduce Exposure**:
   - Restrict unused protocols, ports, and HTTP methods.

9. **Isolated Deployment**:
   - Deploy one application per server, PaaS, or container when feasible.

---

### Application of Zero Trust

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Use MFA and strict RBAC to enforce access controls.
- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Track user and system behavior; revoke access for anomalies.
- **Encryption**:
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit to ensure confidentiality.
- **API Security**:
  - Authenticate, authorize, and validate data for all API calls.
- **Device Validation**:
  - Ensure devices meet security standards before granting access.
- **Cloud and Containerized Environments**:
  - Apply micro-segmentation to cloud-native systems like Kubernetes using network policies to limit lateral movement.

---

### Benefits of Zero Trust

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**:
   - Minimizes vulnerability points.

---

### Sanitize Your Code

Incorporating automated code validation into the development process can help identify and resolve common issues related to memory management and concurrency. This ensures vulnerabilities are addressed early, reducing risks.

#### Key Practices

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors often result from improper memory management.
   - Use automated tools to detect and address these issues before they become exploitable.

2. **Concurrency Issues**:
   - Problems like race conditions can cause unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
   - Automated validation tools can identify synchronization issues or conflicts with shared resources.

3. **Lifecycle Integration**:
   - Integrate code validation tools into your development lifecycle to ensure regular checks.
     - **Pre-Commit**: Run validations before changes are submitted to the repository.
     - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Incorporate validation tools into your CI pipeline to catch vulnerabilities in real time.

---

### Handling Untrusted Data

Untrusted data includes any input received from external sources. Proper validation and sanitization of this data are critical to maintaining system integrity and security.

#### Best Practices

1. **Validation**:
   - Validate all input for:
     - **Type**: Ensure the input matches the expected data type.
     - **Size**: Limit the length of inputs to prevent buffer overflows.
     - **Format**: Verify inputs adhere to the expected structure (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers).
     - **Source**: Accept inputs only from trusted origins.
   - Perform **server-side validation** (client-side validation alone is insufficient).
   - Reject invalid input and provide clear error messages specifying the correct format.
   - Treat special characters with caution and log suspicious input for security analysis.

2. **Escaping Special Characters**:
   - If special characters are required, escape them carefully using:
     - Built-in functions.
     - Trusted third-party libraries or tools.

3. **Transaction Security**:
   - Protect input-driven transactions from **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** using:
     - Tokens.
     - CAPTCHAs.
     - Re-authentication mechanisms.

4. **Output Encoding**:
   - Apply proper encoding to outputs displayed back to users to prevent **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks.

5. **Database Queries**:
   - Use **parameterized queries** or **stored procedures** instead of inline SQL to prevent **SQL injection** attacks.

6. **Redirects and Forwards**:
   - Validate and whitelist URLs for any redirects or forwards to avoid untrusted redirection vulnerabilities.

7. **HTTP Verbs**:
   - Disable unused HTTP methods (e.g., `TRACE`, `OPTIONS`) to reduce potential attack surfaces.

---

## Identity Management

Identity Management encompasses the processes, technologies, and policies for managing user identities and controlling access to system resources. It ensures that the right individuals access the right resources at the right time for the right reasons. Two critical components are **Authentication** and **Authorization**.

---

### Authentication (AuthN)

Authentication confirms the identity of a user, system, or application, answering the question: "Are you who you claim to be?"

#### Key Concepts

1. **Credentials**: Information users provide to verify their identity.
   - Examples: Usernames, passwords, biometric data (e.g., fingerprints), or smart cards.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Requires two or more verification factors.
   - Factors:
     - Something you know (password).
     - Something you have (mobile device, smart card).
     - Something you are (biometric data).

3. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
   - Allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials.
   - Simplifies user experience and reduces login frequency.

#### Challenges

- **Credential Management**: Users often struggle to manage multiple credentials, leading to poor practices like password reuse.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Attackers frequently target authentication credentials through phishing or other deceptive means.

---

### Authorization (AuthZ)

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user is permitted to perform or what resources they can access.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Define which users or groups can access specific resources.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users. Users inherit permissions based on their roles.

3. **Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)**:
   - Access decisions are based on policies that may include context (e.g., time, location, or resource type).

4. **Tokens**:
   - Authentication generates tokens (e.g., JSON Web Tokens - JWT) to verify identity and permissions for subsequent requests without reauthenticating.

#### Challenges

- **Granularity**: Balancing fine-grained and coarse-grained permissions is challenging.
- **Drift**: Over time, users might accumulate unnecessary permissions, increasing security risks.

---

### Session Management

Sessions maintain user state and interactions, typically using session tokens or IDs.

#### Recommendations

1. **Token Security**:
   - Tokens should be unpredictable, secure, and have a defined expiration.
   - Regenerate tokens during significant events (e.g., authentication or privilege changes).

2. **Session IDs**:
   - Use secure, unpredictable session IDs of at least 128 bits.
   - Transmit only over encrypted channels.
   - Regenerate IDs on login and destroy them upon logout.

3. **General Guidelines**:
   - Use built-in session management from frameworks whenever possible.
   - Treat externally generated session IDs as suspicious and reject them.
   - Secure session tokens with strong encryption and robust access controls.

---

### Privacy and Data Protection

Privacy and data protection aim to safeguard personal and sensitive information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Adhering to data protection laws and best practices ensures compliance and builds user trust.

Key Principles:

1. **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data necessary for specific purposes.
2. **Data Anonymization:** Use techniques like masking or tokenization to protect sensitive data.
3. **User Consent:** Obtain and document user consent for data collection and processing.
4. **Compliance:** Adhere to privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.
5. **Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs):** Regularly evaluate the impact of data processing activities on privacy.

---

## Bounds and Memory Management

Memory management and bounds checking are critical for ensuring application security, especially when working with non-memory-safe languages.

---

### Bounds Checking

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all input data rigorously to prevent buffer overflows.
   - Ensure inputs match expected data types.

2. **Frameworks and Testing**:
   - Leverage frameworks with automatic bounds checking.
   - Implement automated unit tests and engage penetration testers to validate input handling.

3. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct regular reviews to verify that all inputs are properly bounded.

4. **Compiler Options**:
   - Use compiler settings that detect and mitigate bounds-related vulnerabilities.

---

### Advanced Memory Protections

1. **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**:
   - Randomizes memory locations to prevent predictable attacks.
2. **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**:
   - Blocks the execution of non-executable memory regions.
3. **Stack Canary**:
   - Inserts a "canary" value to detect stack-based buffer overflows.

---

### Memory-Safe Languages

Where feasible, choose memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust, Python) to reduce risks related to manual memory management.

---

### Strong Typing and Static Type Checking

1. **Strong Typing**:
   - Enforces compatibility between data types, reducing errors and enhancing security.
   - Avoid untyped primitives; prefer strong types to prevent implicit conversions.

2. **Static Type Checking**:
   - Detects errors during compilation rather than runtime.
   - Provides more reliable validation compared to dynamic type checking.

---

### Advanced Application Security Topics

Modern architectures such as microservices, containers, and serverless computing introduce new security challenges and opportunities. Addressing these requires specialized approaches.

### Modern Security Challenges

1. **Container Security:** Harden images, manage secrets, and isolate workloads.
2. **Serverless Security:** Minimize permissions and secure event triggers.
3. **Microservices:** Enforce service-to-service authentication and limit API exposure.
4. **Cloud-Native Security:** Use cloud provider tools for identity, logging, and monitoring.
5. **Edge Computing Security:** Secure communications between edge devices and cloud systems.
6. **API Gateways and Service Meshes:** Implement security and observability in microservices architectures.

---

## Error Handling, Logging, and Monitoring

### Error Handling

Applications must handle errors gracefully to prevent exposing sensitive information or system details to users or potential attackers.

1. **Catch and Handle All Errors**: Use a global error handler to catch and manage unexpected errors.
2. **Prevent Information Disclosure**: Avoid displaying internal details, stack traces, or crash information to users.
3. **Generic Error Messages**: Keep error messages vague. For instance, during login failures, avoid specifying whether the username or password was incorrect.
4. **Fail Securely**: Always revert to a secure state in case of errors. Do not grant unintended access or complete incomplete transactions.
5. **Security Alerts**: Log security-related errors and integrate them with SIEMs or intrusion detection/prevention systems.
6. **Sanitize Logs**: When logging errors, sanitize all external input to prevent log injection attacks.

---

### Incident Response and Recovery

Incident response ensures that when a security breach or other critical event occurs, the organization can respond promptly and recover effectively. It includes preparation, detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

Key Practices:

1. **Preparation:** Establish an incident response plan and train the team.
2. **Detection and Analysis:** Use monitoring systems to detect incidents and analyze their scope.
3. **Containment:** Limit the spread of the incident to reduce impact.
4. **Eradication:** Remove the root cause of the issue, such as malware.
5. **Recovery:** Restore systems to normal operations, ensuring no residual threats remain.
6. **Post-Incident Review:** Document and analyze the incident to improve future response efforts.
7. **Tabletop Exercises:** Conduct regular incident response simulations to ensure readiness.

---

### Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for understanding system behavior, troubleshooting, and responding to security incidents.

1. **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information, such as PII or authentication credentials.
2. **Log Key Events**:
   - Record login attempts (successful and failed), brute-force attacks, and security events.
   - Include event type, timestamp, source IP, event location (URL), and outcome.
3. **Validate IP Data**: If logging IP addresses using headers like XFF, validate their integrity to avoid manipulation.
4. **Protect Logs**:
   - **Centralized Storage**: Use a unified location with a consistent format for easy integration with SIEMs.
   - **Access Control**: Restrict log access to authorized personnel and log interactions with log files.
   - **Encryption**: Store logs securely in an encrypted format.
   - **Backup and Retention**: Include logs in backup strategies and retain them for adequate periods.
   - **Secure Disposal**: Dispose of logs securely when no longer needed, treating them as sensitive data.
5. **Data Aggregation**: Be mindful of the collective sensitivity of log data. Non-sensitive data points, when combined, might reveal sensitive insights.

---

## Secure Handling of External Dependencies

Reliance on third-party artifacts introduces risks related to availability and security. A compromised or unavailable dependency can disrupt the build process or introduce vulnerabilities.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Mirroring Artifacts**:
   - Host mirrors of third-party artifacts on your servers.
   - While this reduces risk, maintaining mirrors requires resources.
2. **Hash Verification**:
   - Store hashes of third-party artifacts in your repository to detect tampering.
   - Halt builds if hashes do not match.
3. **Vendoring Dependencies**:
   - Check dependencies into source control to secure and lock exact versions.
   - Prevents external tampering and ensures availability.

---

### Supply Chain Security

Software supply chains can introduce vulnerabilities through third-party components or compromised dependencies. Protecting these chains is critical to overall application security.

Best Practices:

1. **Vendor Vetting:** Evaluate the security posture of third-party providers.
2. **Dependency Management:** Use tools like SCA to monitor for vulnerabilities.
3. **Version Pinning:** Lock dependencies to specific, secure versions.
4. **Tamper Detection:** Verify integrity with checksums and hashes.

---

### Code Reviews, SCA, and SAST

Regular code reviews, software composition analysis (SCA), and static application security testing (SAST) help identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

#### Code Reviews

Code reviews involve systematically checking a developer's code for errors, vulnerabilities, and adherence to standards.

- **Manual Reviews**:
  - Developers inspect code for errors, vulnerabilities, and compliance.
  - Focus on security patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Reviews**:
  - Use tools to enforce coding standards and detect common errors.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Knowledge Sharing**: Promotes team collaboration and learning.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity in style and approach.
  - **Reduced Bugs**: Detects and fixes bugs, especially security-related ones, before production.

---

#### Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

SCA tools analyze components like libraries and frameworks to identify vulnerabilities and licensing issues.

- **Process**:
  - Create an inventory of components and their dependencies.
  - Match components against vulnerability databases like NVD.
  - Recommend patches or updates for vulnerable components.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Security**: Identifies risks in third-party components.
  - **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to licensing terms.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**: Alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities.
  - **Integration**: Works with CI/CD pipelines for automated scanning.

---

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST analyzes source, bytecode, or binary code without execution to detect security vulnerabilities.

- **Process**:
  - Check configuration files for adherence to best practices.
  - Trace data flows to identify risks like data leaks or untrusted input execution.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Early Detection**: Identifies vulnerabilities during development.
  - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Ensures a thorough examination of the codebase.
  - **CI/CD Integration**: Automates scanning during code integration.

By combining secure error handling, robust logging, careful dependency management, and comprehensive code analysis, organizations can build resilient and secure software systems.

### Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege (PoLP) recommends granting only the minimal access or permissions necessary to perform a function.

- **Containment of Damage**: By limiting permissions, errors or malicious exploitation are restricted. For example, a component without database access cannot tamper with the database, even if compromised.
- **Application Levels**: PoLP applies to users, applications, and processes. For instance:
  - A user account for a specific task should have only the permissions needed for that task.
  - A service running on a server should operate with the lowest privilege level required to function.

---

### Avoid Security by Obscurity

Security by obscurity relies on secrecy in design, implementation, or flaws as the primary defense mechanism.

- **Supplement, Not Replace**: While secrecy can add defense layers, it should not be the main security mechanism. Once the secret is compromised, the system becomes vulnerable.
- **Adopt Proven Mechanisms**: Use well-established, peer-reviewed security protocols instead of relying on obscurity or proprietary, untested algorithms. Open-source solutions are often more secure due to community scrutiny.

---

### Usability and Security Balance

Balancing usability and security ensures that security measures do not hinder user experience. Usable security reduces friction and enhances adoption without sacrificing protection.

Best Practices:

1. **Password Policies:** Avoid overly complex requirements that encourage insecure storage.
2. **Simplified MFA:** Use user-friendly MFA options like push notifications.
3. **Minimal Intrusion:** Prompt users for additional verification only when needed.
4. **Clear Communication:** Provide concise and actionable security prompts.

---

### Regular Security Testing

Regular security testing identifies vulnerabilities in software to ensure they are addressed before attackers exploit them.

- **Evolving Risks**: As software evolves, new vulnerabilities emerge. Continuous testing helps stay ahead of potential threats.
- **Testing Methods**:
  - **Penetration Testing**: Simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
  - **Vulnerability Assessments**: Systematic reviews of weaknesses, providing severity ratings and mitigation recommendations.
- **Actionable Insights**: After identifying vulnerabilities, prioritize and address them based on their severity and potential impact.

  - Patch the operating system.
  - Harden network configurations.
  - Secure against known attack vectors.
- **Minimize Attack Surface**: Disable unnecessary services, applications, or features to reduce entry points for attackers.
- **Configuration Management**: Verify that security-related configurations are correct to prevent vulnerabilities from misconfigurations.

---

### Understanding APIs

An API (Application Programming Interface) enables communication and interaction between different software components.

#### Key Points

- **Boundary Definition**: APIs define operations and enforce access controls for software interactions.
- **Client Interaction**: APIs serve clients, which may include user-facing applications or other APIs.
- **Difference from UIs**: APIs enable software-to-software interactions, focusing on data and structure. UIs prioritize user experience and presentation.

- **Support for Multiple Protocols**: Beyond HTTP, RPC can leverage protocols like DCOM, CORBA, or Java RMI, providing diverse communication methods.
- **Tight Coupling**: Enables a closer connection between client and server for optimized and efficient communication.
- **Binary Protocols**: Many RPC systems use binary formats, which are more efficient than text-based formats like JSON or XML.
- **Streaming Support**: Modern RPC frameworks like gRPC offer streaming for requests and responses, facilitating interactive and real-time communication.

#### Disadvantages

- **Vendor Lock-In**: Often relies on specific libraries or tools, potentially tying developers to a particular vendor's ecosystem.
- **Lack of Standardization**: The absence of universal standards can make RPC harder to understand and implement compared to REST.
- **Tight Coupling Risks**: Changes to the server can easily break clients, requiring careful management of dependencies and updates.
- **Complexity**: Advanced RPC frameworks can have a steep learning curve due to their extensive feature sets.
- **Debugging Challenges**: Binary protocols, while efficient, are less human-readable, making debugging more difficult.
- **Firewall Restrictions**: Non-HTTP/HTTPS RPC calls may be blocked by firewalls, creating communication barriers.

### GraphQL

#### Advantages

- **Flexible Data Retrieval**: Clients can request exactly what they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL APIs are defined by a schema specifying the types of data that can be fetched and the set of operations that can be performed.
- **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, which often requires multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL typically exposes a single endpoint for all interactions.
- **Real-Time Data with Subscriptions**: GraphQL supports subscriptions, allowing clients to receive real-time data updates after the initial query.
- **Auto-Generating Documentation**: Tools like GraphiQL provide automatically generated documentation for the schema, making it easier for developers to understand and explore the API.

#### Disadvantages

- **Complexity**: For simple APIs, GraphQL can be overkill and introduce unnecessary complexity.
- **Performance Concerns**: Complex queries can potentially lead to performance issues if a client requests a large amount of data in a single query.
- **Caching Challenges**: The flexible nature of GraphQL can make client-side caching more complex compared to REST.

### REST and HTTP

- **Stateless Nature of HTTP**: Each request from a client contains all the information needed to service the request, and session state is kept entirely on the client. For example, once authenticated, the client must include authentication details in every request.
- **Cacheability**: Responses can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. Cacheable responses reduce interactions with the server, improving performance and reducing load.
- **Layered System**: Clients are typically unaware of whether they are connected to the end server or an intermediary. This enables load balancing and shared caching.
- **Code on Demand (Optional)**: Servers can deliver executable code, such as client-side scripts, to extend the client's functionality related to the application.

### RPC and HTTP

- **HTTP as a Common Transport Layer**: Modern RPC frameworks, like JSON-RPC or XML-RPC, benefit from HTTP's widespread adoption and features.
- **Statelessness in RPC over HTTP**: Each RPC call should encapsulate all the information the server needs to understand and process the request.
- **Cacheability**: RPC calls over HTTP can use HTTP caching mechanisms when responses are deterministic and idempotent.
- **Layered System**: RPC over HTTP benefits from HTTP's layered system, enabling optimization through proxies or load balancers.
- **Extensibility with HTTP Headers**: HTTP headers can carry metadata or auxiliary information alongside RPC calls.

### GraphQL and HTTP

- **HTTP as the Transport Layer**: While GraphQL isn't tied to HTTP, it often uses it as the transport layer, leveraging features like statelessness and cacheability.
- **Stateless Nature of HTTP**: Each GraphQL request contains all necessary information, including authentication details, query specifics, and variables, ensuring simplicity and scalability.
- **Cacheability**: GraphQL's flexible query structure introduces caching challenges. Solutions like persisted queries, where a query hash is sent instead of the full query, can improve cacheability.
- **Layered System**: GraphQL supports layered systems, with intermediaries like caching layers or load balancers optimizing traffic before reaching the server.
- **Extensibility**: Custom GraphQL directives allow for transforming result shapes and values, offering functionality similar to REST's "Code on Demand."

### Securing GraphQL APIs

1. Limit query depth and complexity to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
2. Use query whitelisting or persisted queries to restrict accepted queries.
3. Monitor usage patterns for anomalies or abusive behavior.

### API Security in Context

API security requires a holistic approach to protect APIs, the backbone of modern applications. Whether using REST, RPC, or GraphQL, security should address potential risks and incorporate best practices. This includes not only technical measures but also processes and policies for continuous monitoring, timely updates, and rapid incident response.

#### Key Considerations

- **Assets**: Identify valuable components of your system—data, resources, or devices. Anything that poses a risk upon compromise is an asset requiring protection.
- **Security Goals**: Define objectives to secure your assets. These goals, akin to non-functional requirements (NFRs), can be difficult to quantify but are crucial for maintaining system integrity.
- **Environment and Threat Models**: Understand your API's operating environment and the potential threats. While absolute security is unattainable, prioritizing realistic threats helps focus efforts and address vulnerabilities effectively.

### API Security Essentials

1. **API Operation Constraints**
   - Ensure that an API only allows operations that a caller has permission to perform, based on the API's predefined rules and definitions.

2. **Endpoint Security**
   - Prioritize the security of API endpoints against unauthorized access and potential malicious attacks.
   - Implement rate limiting, authentication, and authorization mechanisms to safeguard endpoints.

3. **Data Security**
   - Encrypt data both in transit and at rest to protect against breaches.
   - Utilize protocols such as SSL/TLS for data in transit and employ robust encryption mechanisms for stored data.

4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
   - Ensure that only authorized entities, whether they are individuals or systems, can access the API.
   - Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms like OAuth, JWT, and API keys.

5. **Threat Modeling**
   - Systematically identify potential threats targeting the API.
   - Design and implement countermeasures to address threats, including DDoS attacks and injection attacks.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Log all API access and activities for auditing purposes.
   - Monitor for and flag any suspicious or anomalous activities for further investigation.

7. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement mechanisms to limit the number of API requests from a user or system within a specified time frame to prevent potential abuse.

8. **Input Validation**
   - Rigorously validate and sanitize data sent to the API to ensure its integrity and safety.
   - Implement measures to guard against attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

9. **Access Control and User Roles**
   - Recognize that APIs may be accessed by users with different levels of authority.
   - Designate certain operations for specific roles, like administrators, and ensure robust access controls to prevent unauthorized actions.

10. **Holistic Security Considerations**
    - Understand that while individual API operations may be secure in isolation, their combinations could introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Design APIs that consider the broader security implications, such as ensuring transactional integrity in financial operations.

11. **Implementation Vulnerabilities**
    - Recognize that the method of API implementation can be a source of security risks.
    - For example, failing to validate input sizes can lead to vulnerabilities like denial of service (DoS) attacks.

12. **Designing for Security**
    - Opt for API designs that inherently prioritize security.
    - Use tools and methodologies that enhance security, and integrate security considerations from the onset of the development process rather than as an afterthought.
