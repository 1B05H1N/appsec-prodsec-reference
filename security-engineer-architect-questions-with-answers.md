### Encryption and Authentication Concepts

#### 1. Three-Way Handshake
- **Definition**: A method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between a client and server. 
- **Process**: 
  1. **SYN**: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) message to the server.
  2. **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge).
  3. **ACK**: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) message back to the server.

#### 2. Cookies
- **Function**: Cookies are small pieces of data stored by a browser on the user's device, used to remember information about the user for web applications.
- **Usage**: They are used for session management, personalization, and tracking.

#### 3. Sessions
- **Definition**: A session is a way to store information across multiple web pages.
- **Mechanism**: A unique session ID is generated and stored in a cookie on the user's browser, which is matched with the session information on the server side.

#### 4. OAuth
- **Purpose**: OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, used to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites without giving them the passwords.
- **Process**: 
  1. User requests access.
  2. Application requests authorization from the service.
  3. User grants permission.
  4. Application receives an authorization token.
  5. Application requests access token.
