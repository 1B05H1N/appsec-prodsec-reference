- [ ] Document potential attack vectors.
- [ ] Create a threat model using frameworks like **STRIDE**, **DREAD**, or **PASTA**.

---

### Information Gathering

This phase involves collecting all relevant details about the application or system to ensure a focused and effective assessment.

1. Gather documentation on the system architecture.
2. Enumerate assets (e.g., servers, databases, third-party services).
3. Identify data flow diagrams and architecture-related resources.
4. Document the technology stack (e.g., languages, frameworks, libraries).

---

## Assessment Phase

- [ ] Review data validation and output encoding functions.
- [ ] Check for hard-coded credentials.
- [ ] Evaluate error-handling mechanisms.
- [ ] Review session management.

---

### Dynamic Analysis (Runtime Analysis)

Dynamic analysis evaluates the system during execution to uncover runtime vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Execute common web application attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS).
- [ ] Analyze input validation mechanisms.
- [ ] Test file upload functionality.
- [ ] Assess rate-limiting and anti-automation controls.
- [ ] Validate HTTPS configurations and encryption measures.

---

### Cloud Services Assessment

Cloud service assessments focus on the security of cloud-based components and configurations.

- [ ] Evaluate IAM roles, permissions, and policies.
- [ ] Review cloud storage permissions.

---

## Post-Assessment Phase

The **Post-Assessment Phase** synthesizes findings, creates a comprehensive report, and develops a remediation plan to address identified vulnerabilities. Key stakeholders are consulted for feedback, and the final report includes risk assessments and prioritized recommendations. This phase also involves tracking remediation efforts and often culminates in a re-assessment to ensure effective mitigation. It serves as a wrap-up and follow-up stage, ensuring that lessons learned are documented for continuous improvement.

---

### Reporting

The **reporting process** compiles the findings of the security review into a detailed document outlining vulnerabilities, risks, and recommendations. This document is initially shared as a draft for stakeholder feedback and finalized to serve as both a record of the assessment and a roadmap for remediation efforts.

#### Reporting Checklist

- [ ] Draft preliminary findings.
- [ ] Share draft with stakeholders for review and feedback.
- [ ] Finalize the report, including risk assessments and actionable recommendations.

---

### Vendor Management

**Vendor management** involves evaluating the security posture of third-party vendors and integrations to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities. This process includes verifying compliance with security obligations and Service Level Agreements (SLAs), often requiring collaboration with vendors to address identified issues.

#### Vendor Management Checklist

- [ ] Evaluate security measures of third-party vendors and integrations.
- [ ] Confirm vendors meet contractual security obligations (e.g., SLAs).

---

### Remediation

**Remediation** focuses on implementing fixes and countermeasures to address identified vulnerabilities and risks. These efforts are prioritized based on a risk assessment, with the most critical issues addressed first.

#### Remediation Checklist

- [ ] Develop a remediation plan with clear timelines.
- [ ] Prioritize fixes based on risk severity and impact.
- [ ] Assign responsibilities for each remediation action.

---

### Follow-Up/Retrospective

The **Follow-Up/Retrospective** process involves reviewing the assessment's success and identifying opportunities for improvement. This phase tracks remediation efforts, evaluates their effectiveness, and documents lessons learned for future assessments.

#### Follow-Up/Retrospective Checklist

- [ ] Track remediation progress and status.
- [ ] Conduct a re-assessment to verify fixes.
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future assessments.
